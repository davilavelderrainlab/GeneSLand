GeneSLand (Gene Specificity Landscape) is an R package for comparative 
transcriptomic analysis following the framework described in [Bot and Davila-Velderrain, 2025].

# Analysis tools

GeneSLand contains functions to:

- Create a Specificity Single Cell Experiment Object (`SSCE`)
- Calculate the Specificity scores (`AUC`, `dRate`, `lbSpec`)
- Plot the Specificity landscape
- Plot the expression Breadth-expression Level (LB) lines
- Map new genes/gene groups on an existing SSCE
- All the SSCE objects described in the [article]

In the [vignette], we provide an example on how to build and visualize a SSCE.

# Basic installation
